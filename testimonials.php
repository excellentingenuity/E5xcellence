        		"Have known Tim for over 15 years and worked directly with him for 7 years. He is a strategic & systems thinker who easily views things at a high level, and yet knows how to translate and communicate at a detailed level for front-end results. While working with him at Laurens County Healthcare System he transformed the Patient Financial Services area during some challenging times with healthcare changes that occurred at both the state and national levels. The hospital was managed by QHR (Quorum Health Resources) and the outcome metrics were constantly in the in the top 25%, achieving an award for best practices at one of the national meetings. Also, while at LCHCS, we implemented a Service Excellence Program and Tim was selected as a chairman of the Service Excellence Team. He led a rigorous three year implementation team to hardwire changes. Also, he was able to integrate a continuous process improvement mindset to staff, realizing that as the healthcare and local environments change, internal processes need to be evaluated for potential improvements. Since leaving LCHCS in 2007, I have maintained close contact with Tim as a great colleague and subject matter expert in Service Excellence, Revenue Cycle Management, Change Management, and his general healthcare industry knowledge."<br />
